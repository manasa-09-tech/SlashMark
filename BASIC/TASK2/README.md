Keylogger Software

Description
        This is a beginner-level cybersecurity project that demonstrates how a keylogger works. 
        A keylogger is a type of software used to record every keystroke made by the user on a keyboard.
        The purpose of this project is to understand how data is captured from input devices for learning and ethical security testing purposes.
