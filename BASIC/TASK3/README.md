ðŸš€ How to Run

      1. Install Node.js & Dependencies
      
            npm install
      
      2. Encrypt an Image
      
            node index.js -e nmap.png
      
      âž¡ Outputs:
      
            nmap_encrypted.png in dist/
      
            nmap_key.txt in dist/
      
      
      3. Decrypt the Image
      
            node index.js -d dist/nmap_encrypted.png -k dist/nmap_key.txt
      
      âž¡ Outputs:

            decrypted_nmap.png in dist/
